Using Micropython and a Pico W to build a simple temperature server. 

The client is written in Rust (Python version pending).

The server uses a ssd3106 OLED 128x32 display. The next step is to add a BME280 sensor.

Aim: The server will collect temp readings over a 24hr period and when requested by the client send the data to the client in JSON format for further processing.
